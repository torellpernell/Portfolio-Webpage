        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a Full Stack Java Software Engineer currently located in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
        <p>Applying my strong work ethic in all of my endeavors, I attained a Master's degree in Computer Science from Chicago State University, conducted and contributed to socio-economic research studies, and also gained extensive practical skills working with some of the most popular software technologies used in modern enterprises today.</p>
        <p>The various technologies that I have worked with encompass the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-level programming,</li>
          <li>Web development frameworks,</li>
          <li>Testing and quality assurance, and</li>
          <li>Backend infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>About Torell</h2>
        <hr>     
        <p>I am a passionate Web developer who enjoys discovering creative solutions to technical problems. I view challenges as an opportunity to learn and grow. Software development is a field I have been involved in for several years and I continue to learn new and exciting things.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p>I enjoy working with teams of fellow developers and engineers to design and build products that meet the needs of businesses and stakeholders. I am great at self-organization and also able to collaborate with other developers to accomplish tasks and meet project objectives.</p>
      
        <p>During my infrequent escapes from the world of software development, I enjoy to spend time reading biographies, cooking and spending time with my family, and traveling domestically.</p>
